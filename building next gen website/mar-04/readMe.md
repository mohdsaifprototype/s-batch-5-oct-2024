position: static | relative | absolute | sticky | fixed;

relative vs. absolute

sticky vs fixed

absolute and fixed don't reserve space in the document
while relative and sticky do.

when we set position other than static then we can apply the following CSS properties:

1. top: <length>;
2. right: <length>;
3. bottom: <length>;
4. left: <length>;
5. z-index: <integer>;
